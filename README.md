# LIBRVRY
LIBRVRY is a lightweight, client-side web project that turns a folder of book covers into a tactile, swipeable pile. Covers animate into a centered stack, preserve native aspect ratios, never upscale beyond their original size, and support touch, keyboard, and autoplay interactions. Designed to feel physical rather than UI-like.
